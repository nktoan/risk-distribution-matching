# Domain Generalisation via Risk Distribution Matching

This is the source code for replicating the results from our paper accepted to **WACV'24 (Research Track)**: **'Domain Generalisation via Risk Distribution Matching'**.

Thank you for your interest!

## Structure of the Repository

The repository is structured into two distinct sub-repositories, each aligned with the experiments highlighted in our study. These are:

1. CMNIST
2. DomainBed

Each of these sub-repositories comes with its individual README. These documents provide detailed steps for setting things up and replicating the experiments. We have separated these sub-repositories to:

- Enable users to leverage existing benchmark code, notably from DomainBed.
- Allow users to focus on specific sub-repositories of their choice without dealing with unnecessary installation requirements.

## Citation

If you employ the codes or datasets provided in this repository or utilize our proposed method as comparison baselines in your experiments, please cite our paper. Again, thank you for your interest!
