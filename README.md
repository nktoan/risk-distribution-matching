# Domain Generalisation via Risk Distribution Matching

This is the source code for replicating the results from our paper accepted to WACV'24 (Research Track): *Domain Generalisation via Risk Distribution Matching*.

Thank you for your interest!

## Structure of the Repository

The repository is structured into two distinct sub-repositories, each aligned with the experiments highlighted in our study. These are:

1. CMNIST
2. DomainBed

Each of these sub-repositories comes with its individual README. These documents provide detailed steps on setting things up and replicating the experiments. We have separated these sub-repositories to:

- Enable users to leverage existing benchmark code, notably from DomainBed.
- Allow users to focus on specific sub-repositories of their choice without dealing with unnecessary installation requirements.
